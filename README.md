# Magic 8 Ball App

Welcome to the Magic 8 Ball App, a fun and interactive application developed in Swift to provide users with answers to their questions. This project allowed me to practice my basic Swift skills, including designing the user interface and assets, changing UI elements programmatically, detecting user interaction and responding to it, using Swift variables and arrays to store data, and incorporating randomization.

## Features

- Ask a Question: Users can ask any question they have in mind by shaking the device or tapping the "Ask" button.

- Random Answers: The app provides a randomized set of answers from a predefined array of responses, ensuring a unique response to each question.

- Fun User Experience: The Magic 8 Ball App creates an enjoyable user experience by simulating the classic Magic 8 Ball toy's mystical and mysterious responses.
  
## How It Works

The Magic 8 Ball App is built using Swift and incorporates the following concepts:

- **User Interface Design**: The app's user interface is designed to be visually appealing and intuitive, creating an engaging user experience.

- **Randomization**: Swift's random number generation is used to select a random answer from a predefined array of responses.

- **User Interaction**: The app detects user actions such as shaking the device or tapping the "Ask" button to trigger the generation of a random answer.

- **Swift Variables and Arrays**: Swift variables and arrays are used to store the possible answers and retrieve a random response to display to the user.
